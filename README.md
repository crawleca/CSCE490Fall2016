# SCDOTProject: Signs Survey App

We currently have a project with the SCDOT that is in part collecting data on the retroreflectivity of highway signs.
We currently have a database of 500,000+ signs in the state and we will be selecting signs to measure the retroreflectivity.
An Android app that would read the bar-code tag on the sign and the assemble, allow the collection of the measured data that is
manually entered, record a picture of the sign, as well as verify GPS coordinates and direction the sign is facings would be useful.
